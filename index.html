            <p>In the nearly two decades since their launch, 
                <br>Swedish metallers Sabaton have carved out a 
                <br>reputation as one of the hardest working bands in the business – 
                <br>gaining a legion of loyal fans across the globe, 
                <br>delivering eight highly-rated studio albums 
                <br>(including two certified platinum-sellers), 
                <br>and scoring multiple industry award wins and nominations… 
                <br>not to mention launching their own annual festival and cruise.
                <br><br>Combining soaring power riffs with vocalist Joakim Brodén’s 
                <br>-recognisable gruff baritone, the band refuses to be simply 
                <br>into a genre. Fans need only know them as Sabaton: the heavy 
                <br>metal band that sings of real life wars and the people who 
                <br>played a part in them – of gruelling campaigns and dazzling 
                <br>of bravery, of magnificent victories and touching personal 
                <br>struggles – true stories more fantastic than any fiction.

                <br><br>Sabaton are perhaps best known for their electrifying 
                <br>live concerts, combining accomplished musical performances and a 
                <br>finely-crafted stage show – including their full-sized tank 
                <br>drum-riser – with energy and laughter. The band has headlined 
                <br>as far afield as North America, Australia and Japan, and regularly 
                <br>fills arenas and takes top-billed slots at festivals across Europe.
                
                <br><br>Fresh from a long bout of touring, the band is looking forward 
                <br>to a number of festival appearances this summer before returning to 
                <br>studio to work on their next project.
